                <h1>What do we really do?</h1>
                <p>Coaching emphasizes autonomy, voice, and choice.
                    Clients come to coaching with an interest in self-improvement or measurable progress.
                    Through coaching, clients find insight and direction to identify practical means to
                    reach their goals. The coach guides and supports the client’s planned, intentional, and
                    purposeful action toward achievement from a place of openness, acceptance, and
                    non-judgment.</p>

                <h2>Why do I need coaching?</h2>
                <p>It’s a fact that life in general is always changing, then add the pressures of work, family and other obligations, it can become overwhelming or directionless. Coaching is a tool we can all benefit from, it helps us create a 3-dimensional awareness of ourselves and what we can do about it, through deep and meaningful introspective questions that will lead us to see something we couldn’t before. Coaching can help you, if you’re willing to listen to yourself.</p>
