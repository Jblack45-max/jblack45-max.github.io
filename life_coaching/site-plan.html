       Oscar: I was born in raised in Utah, always been drawn to the outdoors. Something about fresh air and less distractions always seems to center me.  My family and I remain in Utah, as it offers a variety of outdoor activities where we can enjoy nature.
Professionally, over the past 20 years of my life, I’ve been in several industries and various positions within those industries. The one consistent thing I encountered was every time I thought I knew it all; truth is, I didn’t. Luckily for me, I found some amazing mentors and coaches that helped me understand where I was at and helped me look intrinsically at where I wanted to go next. I set my action plans and executed. Twenty years later, I have to say, it’s been a successful path.
Throughout my career, I’ve always looked for opportunities to “pay it forward” by doing for others what my mentors and coaches did for me. This led me to enrolling and attending an accredited course through University of Utah's Business and Life Coaching program associated with Peak Performance Coaching Academy with hopes of seeking an ICF accreditation. I’m glad I made the investment! ICF (International Coaching Federation) is the leading global organization for coaches and coaching professionals.

<br>Shamie: I am a mom of 4 beautiful children, and 3 grandchildren, and I am married to the love of my life. I love my family and I am learning the importance and impact of loving myself. I am passionate about helping others find that as well. I love the sun, especially when its on a beach, attached to the ocean anywhere it’s hot! I love people, all people and I believe that I connect easily with most of them. I live in Eagle Mountain, Utah, with my husband, our youngest son & my father-in-law. 
I have had the amazing experience running my own business, doing nails for the last 15 years. While doing nails, I was connecting with my clients on a deep level, and I believe, making a difference for good in their lives. Through owning a thriving business, I learned what it takes to work closely with others, be great at problem solving, successfully managing finances and understanding the value of quality work and ethics in the workplace. I have learned that you need to put yourself first in order to be successful in everything else that you do!
